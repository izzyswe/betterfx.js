# betterfx.js
Think of powerfx but better

## Goal
I want to make a library with simplicity but resuable code having a react like composability into a single file given there is a restriction in using one file
What I hope to implement is the following:
- Include native web components for html DOM resuability
- turn common snippets of code into easy to understand function
- have little but sufficient amount of ultity functions to help extend the functionality
- be a small library to not take up too much kb or mb if possible, basically lesser => beeter or something like that

## purpose
Whether it gains traction or not, who knows

sometimes you are restricted to using only one file per web resources.
Basically whether you use pcf or web resources in model driven app you may come across using javascript.
the point is make it a python/powerfx like experience
ease of use like powerfx but extensibility and simplicity like python.

A library of commonly used lines of code compact into functions with callback functions.
If you find yourself familarized in powerfx but don't know how to code in javascript, and you need to extend the functionality of a powerapp
my hope is to close that gap via using this library to help extend your use with ease and simplicity.




Also, I am a dumbass so please feel free to contribute and add more functionality or optimize the shit code!

P.S if you add an html and css to test, pls make sure to delete them, i have bad habit of this so i made a gitignore for that reason :D
